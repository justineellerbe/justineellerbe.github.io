            <h3>Forms</h3>
            <p>
                Forms are made up of a &lt;form&gt; element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.</li>
                    <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Form Controls
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>&lt;input&gt; fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
                    <li>&lt;select&gt; menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                    <li>&lt;textarea&gt; elements for longer text entry</li>
                    <li>&lt;button&gt; elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Input Fields
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>input type='password' is used to enter passwords or secret information. This works in the same way as an input field with type='text', except the characters are concealed as they are entered so they’re unable to be read on the screen.</li>
                    <li>Check boxes are created using input fields with type='checkbox' . They are used to select different options that can be checked (true) or left unchecked (false). The user can selectmore than one checkboxfrom a list.</li>
                    <li>Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio' . Like checkboxes they allow users to check an option as true , but they provide an exclusive choice of options, soonly one optioncan be selected.</li>
                    <li>Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden' . These are not displayed by the browser, but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. They are often used to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided.</li>
                    <li>A file input field can be created using input fields with type='file' . These are used to upload files, and most browsers will provide a browse button or similar that lets users select a file from their file system.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                OOP is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>Three main concepts: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality.</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation. </li>
                    <li>Inheritance means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Property Attributes and Descriptors
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>value ― This is the value of the property and is undefined by default</li>
                    <li>writable ― This boolean value shows whether a property can be changed or not, and is false by default</li>
                    <li>enumerable ― this boolean value shows whether a property will show up when the object is displayed in a for in loop, and is false by default</li>
                    <li>configurable ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete a property or change any of its attributes, and is false by default.</li>
                    <li>An object property descriptor can have get() and set() methods instead of a value attribute. All objects must have one or the other, they can't have both. The get() and set() methods can be used to control how a property is set using assignment and the value that is returned when a property is queried.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Modular JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
                    <li>This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability.</li>
                    <li>The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                ES6 Modules
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
                    <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
            </p>
