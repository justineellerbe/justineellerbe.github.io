            <h3>The Window Object</h3>
            <p>
                Browser Object Model
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>A collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>There is no official standard for the BOM, but there are a number of properties and methods that
                        are supported by all the major browsers.</li>
                    <li>Dialog methods will stop the execution of a program in it's tracks. This means that everything
                        will stop processing at the point the method is called, until the user clicks <i>OK</i> or
                        <i>Cancel</i>.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Document Object
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal
                        with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
                    <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer. Cookies can be used for
                        personalizing a userâ€™s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user
                        choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Timing Functions
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>There are useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly
                        executing functions at regular intervals.</li>
                    <li>Methods: .setTimeout(), .setInterval(), and .clearInterval()</li>

            <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
            <p>
                HTML5
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>This specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed.</li>
                    <li>The <em>data-</em> attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JS.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML5 APIs
                <ul id="ulOne">
                    <li>APIs help gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card.</li>
                    <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</li>
                    <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. It can be used to find the user's exact location, the link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.</li>
                    <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a  popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system.</li>
                </ul>
